                had an amazing experience here. I signed up foe the free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the bes - and most grueling -
                time of my life. Since completing the course I've successfully
                switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR

                  "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of
                  code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
                  me learn programing step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                  by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                  things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                  not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                  wait long fo assistance. The agile team project, in
                  particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
                  level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, Ive
                  often referred to it during my interviews as an example of my
                  development experience. It certainly helped me land a hof as a
                  full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                  recommend."
