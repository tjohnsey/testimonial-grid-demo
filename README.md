## My process
First attempt at making a grid with CSS. 
Used a basic 12x12 grid as the template.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Custom variables

Basic CSS grid structure

#### Continued development
Need to continue working on positioning containers so they show properly in the cent of screens
Stuck trying to move the quotation behind the text, and keep it visable
Need to develop better CSS skills to reduce cluttter
